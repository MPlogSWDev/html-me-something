         <p> I once got in trouble for staying after school to play Oregon Trail on an Apple lle in the computer lab at Delmar Harvard in U-City.<br>
             My parents didn't know I was staying after class. I was in first grade and rode my bike to school every day.... Alone... Times have changed!

            <p> This is the first Flight Simulator I remember playing. It was called "Apache Strike" and was barley playable. No instructions... Just trial and error </p>
