      <h1> Some influences (mostly video games...) :</h1>

         <h2>As a kid i fell in love with computers...<br>Frist, was with Oregon Tral!</h2>
         <img src="images\c94ba4181b4d655d43811096697b927a.jpg" alt="Oregon Trail" style="width:1000px;height:900px;" id = oregonTrail>
         <p> I once got in trouble for staying after school to play Oregon Trail on an Apple lle in the computer lab.
             My parents didn't know I was staying after class. I was in first grade and rode my bike to school every day.... Alone... Times have changed!

            <h2>We got our first mac! It was black and white....</h2>
            <img src="images\apachestrike_1.jpg" alt="Apache Strike!" style="width:1000px;height:1000px;" id = apache>
            <p> I wan't allowed to have a video game system at home so this was groundbreaking for me. This is the first Flight Simulator I remember playing. 
               It was called "Apache Strike" and was barley playable. No instructions... 
               Just trial and error. This is the actual gameplay graphics. </p>

               <img src="images\keen4.png" alt="Commander Keen" style="width:1250px;height:1000px;" id = commanderKeen>
               <p> This is Commander Keen. It was one of my earliest games I remember playing in color on our PC. Pionts are scored for jumping on sluggs with a pogo stick,
                   collecting candy and shooting alliens with a ray gun. Enough said... </p>

                  <p>Our first OSP was Compuserve. We had dial-up until the point I left home. Despite the limitaions there was still a ton possible...
                     Like downloading new games and screensavers!

                     <p>These are the first games I remember enjoying that are 3D first person shooter's. 
                        They where both something I downloded, I think each of them took all day...
                         Doom was a favorite but we were still on dial-up internet. On-line gaming was completly out of the question. 
                         I spent days working on tweeking the video card and driver setings just to make them playable.</p>

                           <p>I lived for two years before turning 18 with my grandmother. 
                              She had a new Gateway and Broadband. I spent many nights experiencing <br>on-line gaming for the first time. Windows 98
                              was the current OS and .mp3's were available on Napster. At the age of 16 I couldn't have been more up to date in the 
                              computer world. I kept up on new hardware and software releases. I drempt of builing my own computer. 
                              That was all about to change...

                              <p>I moved to the west coast and became involved with my carrer in construction. Any free time was spent out in nature and with friends. I had never owned
                                 my own computer so it didn't feel like I was missing out on much. A new technology was about to make my complacency solidified.

                                 <p>When I left for Oregon I had a cell phone. When I moved back to the midwest in 2004 internet was available on cells. However, it wasn't untill the BlackBerry 
                                    Pearl came out in 2006 that I bought my first smart phone with internet access. Over the next 14 years I upgraded many times. The access to the 
                                 internet and abillity to use apps was all I needed. I always wanted to own a PC but never had the resources matched with a justifialbe use 
                              for one.</p>

                                    <p>After watching a friend go through this program I became aware that a new carrer path was possible for me. 
                                       I never trully lost intrest in computers, I simply didn't have a purpose for them. When the pandemic hit 
                                       I realised it may be a good time to consider this program as realistic. So in June of
                                       2020 I bought my very first personal computer with the intentions of applying to LaunchCode as soon as possible.
                                       Almost a year later I'm enrolled and have just made my first HTML page... Huzzah!
